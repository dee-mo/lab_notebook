      "\n",
      "This continues on the work from 2013-11-08 on creating a simple, extensible energy balance model for energy generation and utilization.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As a starting point, I want to create a model for an MPPT PV panel, a battery, and a load.  This is similar to what I coded for the GHTC 2012 but I want to make the code extensible.  I have two different routines, run_time_step and calculate_LEGP, that do the time stepping but only calculate_LEGP enforces a battery maximum.\n",
