I want to be able to add and choose between different models for each appliance type.  This requires some changes to the code.  First, each appliance should have a way to specify the type of model being used.  Second, there needs to be code that calls the appropriate model type and parameters during the simulation."

In python, I'd be tempted to use a dictionary of objects where each object had a \"generate_time_series\" method.  Maybe the same could be done in matlab?"
