      "Looking at HOMER simulations for Haiti prepared by Dan Schnitzer.  I'm not sure that these are finished, since some of the components don't have a graphical connection to the bus bars.  From the files, it appears that Dan has started looking at grids with CFL vs. LED lighting.  He also has a couple of files that have data on a minute timebase. \n",

      "Dual generators is interesting, if fuel cost dominates, having the capital expenditure from a second generator could be cost effective to avoid operating in a low efficiency regime.  I need to review screening curves and see if there is a simple way to estimate the economics of these choices without a full simulation.  This is starting to remind me of other architecture possibilities such as charging the batteries with a generator so that the generator is operating close to its optimal point.  We need to determine the effective efficiency to measure the savings potential of these ideas.\n",
