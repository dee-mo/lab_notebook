      "I'm not certain yet, but I think that CT markov and time-dependent markov matrices still give the exponential distribution of on and off times.  Semi-Markov can be tuned to create the proper durations.  I have yet to determine exactly how complex developing this model would be.  I initially thought this would be a 20 hour investment but it may be less than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unresolved question for me, is when is the exponential distribution of durations important or unimportant in the modeling.  If these times are unimportant, the inaccuracies of a pure markov approach my be tolerable.\n",

      "\n",
      "We could have two time series with the same mean and different variances.  The overall energy consumed would be equal but the peak power requirements would be different.  The power system would also have to respond to more frequent changes in power level which could affect efficiency.  \n",
